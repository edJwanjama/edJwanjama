Summarry of data issues found, cleaning rules, and assumptions in data set:   Data Issues Found
Duplicate Rows: Some transactions were present more than once, with all columns identical.

Data Type Mismatches: Dates and numeric columns were sometimes stored as text, causing errors in analysis.

Missing Values:

In City, Salesperson, and Channel fields.

Suspicious/Erroneous Values:

Negative UnitPrice detected (should not occur).

DiscountPct above logical business limit (e.g., more than 30%).

RequiredDate sometimes before OrderDate.

Cleaning Rules Applied
Duplicates:

Removed any rows where all columns matched exactly.

Data Types:

Forced OrderDate and RequiredDate to Date type.

Forced UnitCost, UnitPrice, DiscountPct, and Quantity to numeric.

Missing Values:

City: Filled with the most common (mode) city for each country.

Salesperson and Channel: Filled with mode value per region.

If no mode was available, labeled as "Unknown".

Negative/0 UnitPrice:

Set negative UnitPrice to blank/NaN for correction.

Discount > 30%:

Capped all values at 30%.

RequiredDate < OrderDate:

Replaced RequiredDate with OrderDate + 5 days if error detected.

Derived ‘LeadTimeDays’:

Calculated as RequiredDate minus OrderDate (in days).

Key Business Assumptions
Imputation:

When imputing missing values, business logic preferred the “most typical” value at the most granular level available, to best reflect real operations (e.g., City mode within each Country).

Discount Maximum:

No legitimate orders are allowed above a 30% discount (business policy).

Lead Times:

In case of illogical shipping/required dates, a 5-day lead time is assumed as a correction.

PriceBand:

“Low/Medium/High” price bands are defined using quantiles across all products.

No manual re-keying:

All rules are formula-based and can be repeated as new data flows in.

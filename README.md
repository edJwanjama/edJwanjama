👋 Hello there, I'm Ed J Wanjama,

A  data products leader, social impact entrepreneur, thought leader and advocate for ethical tech, entrepreneurship and inclusive innovation.

With over nine years of experience in the SaaS startup ecosystem, I have worked across both technical and leadership roles. As an individual contributor, I was part of teams focused on data scraping, modeling, and mining projects that helped complex manufacturers navigate supply chain compliance and reporting. Later, as a leader, I guided teams to deliver high-impact data-driven innovations, enabling  manufacturers  unlock greater efficiency and value from their complex supply chains.

In 2021, I began sharing some of the supply chain leverage best practices with a small group of social impact startups in my community providing essential services and seeking ways to recover from the disruptions caused by COVID-19. That experience has since led me to social impact entrepreneurship and advocacy for ethical and inclusive innovation.

Currently, I work closely with a portfolio of early-stage social impact ventures that leverage data and machine learning to tackle critical challenges in underserved and unserved markets—with an ethical and inclusive approach.

My mission is to champion thoughtful and ethical innovations across Sub-Saharan Africa, supporting emerging entrepreneurs who are building meaningful, high-impact ethical solutions for their communities.

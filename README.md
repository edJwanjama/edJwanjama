- Hi, I am Ed J. Wanjama, also known as Edward Njeru Wanjama.
- I’m a data scientist, social impact entrepreneur, venture builder, investor, and advocate for ethical and inclusive innovations across Africa.
- I have over 9 years of experience leading data value projects in SaaS and supporting innovations for complex manufacturers navigating supply chain risks and compliance needs.
- I now focus on nurturing early-stage ventures that are harnessing the power of data science and machine learning to solve critical and high-impact problems for underserved markets ethically —especially in sectors like health, education, agriculture, and governance.
- My mission is to champion the next generation of startups grounded in faith, ethics, and passion for inclusive innovation, especially in critical sectors like health, education, food systems, and governance.
- One of my fondest memories was during the pandemic, when I collaborated with 5 niche startups providing critical services, including an award-winning startup. I continue to collaborate with bold founders tackling grassroots problems.
- I'm also a proud neurodiversity advocate, dad, farmer, DIY maker, and CrossFit enthusiast.
- Fun fact: My name means change, new, or evolve.
